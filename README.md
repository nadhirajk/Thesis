# Thesis

Senior thesis in mathematics

Part of mathematics major at Pomona College

Topic: Algorithms and Artificial Intelligence for 2048

Latest version of code is in the 2048-AI folder in 2048 master.ipynb (Jupyter notebook) (currently under expansion, may have bugs)

To run:

Run first cell (game mechanics)
Run second cell (efficient game move implementation)

If you want to try out the different AI:
run the cell with the different AIs
run main()
select 'a' in the gameplay option
choose AI to run

(AI parameters can be edited)

AI 13 (Limited depth Monte Carlo evaluation) is the most successful player so far.
