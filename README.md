# Thesis

(in progress) Senior thesis in mathematics

Part of mathematics major at Pomona College

Topic: Artificial Intelligence

Currently developing AI for the game 2048.

Latest version is in 2048 master.ipynb (iPython Jupyter notebook)

To run:

Run first cell (game mechanics)
Run second cell (efficient game move implementation)

If you want to try out the different AI:
run the cell with the different AIs
run main()
select 'a' in the gameplay option
choose AI to run

(AI parameters can be edited)

AI 12 (Monte Carlo evaluation) is the most successful player so far.
